# phoenix-starter
A starter Elixir/Phoenix project that can be used as a base to build off of

NOTE: This project can be run inside a Docker container for development (in which case it includes a Postgres database container), for production builds (the container has the same OS (Ubuntu 16.04) as the target server to deploy to so the build can use distillery/edeliver to build a release and deploy it to the server), and for tests.

To run inside a Docker container, run all commands as the following:

```
docker-compose [-f docker-compose.<dev|build|test>.yml ...] <service> 
```

To build a release:
* Set the environment variable PHOENIX_STARTER_PROD_HOST to be the domain name you have set up for the server

* Run the container that the build will be performed in
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.build.yml up
```

* Build the release
```
mix edeliver build release --verbose
```
